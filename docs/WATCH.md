# Kody Watch

Periodic health monitoring for your Kody-powered repository. Runs every 30 minutes via GitHub Actions cron, checking pipeline health, security, and configuration. Each agent can also be triggered manually via workflow dispatch using the `--agent` filter.

## How It Works

Kody Watch is a plugin-based watchdog that runs on a fixed 30-minute cron. Each plugin has its own cycle frequency — some run every tick, others run daily. State (cycle counter, dedup timestamps) is persisted as a comment on the activity log issue, so no PAT or special permissions are needed beyond the default `github.token`.

```

    │
    └── kody watch --agent <name>
          └── Run a single plugin on demand
```

Findings are posted as comments on a pinned **activity log issue** — a single place to monitor your repo's health.

## Setup

### Via `kody init` (recommended)

```bash
kody-engine-lite init
```

Init automatically:
- Installs `.github/workflows/kody-watch.yml`
- Adds `watch: { enabled: true }` to `kody.config.json`

Then run `@kody bootstrap` on a GitHub issue — bootstrap creates the activity log issue, pins it, and sets the `WATCH_ACTIVITY_LOG` repository variable.

### Manual Setup

1. Copy [`templates/kody-watch.yml`](../templates/kody-watch.yml) to `.github/workflows/kody-watch.yml`

2. Add to `kody.config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "watch": { "enabled": true }
   }
   ```

3. Create a GitHub issue titled `[Kody Watcher] Activity Log` and set the `WATCH_ACTIVITY_LOG` repository variable to its number:
   ```bash
   gh variable set WATCH_ACTIVITY_LOG --repo owner/repo --body "42"
   ```

## Plugins

### pipeline-health

**Cycle:** every 1 (every 30 min)

Discovers `.kody/tasks/*/status.json` files and evaluates each task:

| Health | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| **stalled** | Running for >30 min without progress |
| **failed** | Pipeline exited with error |
| **healthy** | Running normally or completed |

Posts a comment listing all unhealthy tasks with their status, duration, and failure details.

### security-scan

**Cycle:** every 48 (daily)

Runs four deterministic scans (no LLM, no API keys needed):

| Scan | What it checks | Severity |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Hardcoded secrets | AWS keys, API keys, private keys, JWT tokens in source | critical |
| Dependency vulnerabilities | `npm audit` / `pnpm audit` for critical/high CVEs | high |
| Committed .env files | `.env`, `.env.local`, etc. tracked by git | critical |
| Unsafe code patterns | `eval()`, `innerHTML`, unsanitized `exec` with template literals | high/medium |

Critical findings create individual GitHub issues (max 3 per cycle, deduplicated). All findings are posted to the activity log.

### config-health

**Cycle:** every 48 (daily)

Validates your Kody setup:

- `kody.config.json` exists and is valid JSON
- Required fields set (`github.owner`, `github.repo`)
- Quality commands (`quality.testUnit`) reference existing scripts in `package.json`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret exists
- `.kody/` directory present

## Configuration

```json
{
  "watch": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

That's it. No interval config, no plugin list. The 30-minute tick and plugin schedules are fixed. After bootstrap runs, the config will include the activity log issue number:

```json
{
  "watch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "activityLog": 42
  }
}
```

## Scheduling with Cron

All agents and plugins use **standard 5-field cron expressions** in **UTC**.

### Cron format

```
┌───────────── minute (0–59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0–23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1–31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1–12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0–6, Sun=0)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### How the 30-minute engine affects scheduling

Kody Watch fires every 30 minutes via GitHub Actions. When your cron fires, the engine checks whether the current time falls within a 30-minute window starting at the cron tick. For example, `0 9 * * *` (09:00 UTC) fires at any point between 09:00 and 09:29 UTC.

### Common schedules

| Schedule | Cron | When it fires |
|----------|------|---------------|
| Every 30 min | `* * * * *` | Every engine tick |
| Every 6 hours | `0 */6 * * *` | 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC |
| Every 12 hours | `0 */12 * * *` | 00:00, 12:00 UTC |
| Daily at 09:00 | `0 9 * * *` | 09:00 UTC |
| Weekly Monday 09:00 | `0 9 * * 1` | Every Monday 09:00 UTC |
| Weekly Sunday 10:00 | `0 10 * * 0` | Every Sunday 10:00 UTC |

## Manual Triggering

Use `--agent` to run a single plugin on demand without waiting for the next scheduled tick:

```bash
kody watch --agent pipeline-health
kody watch --agent security-scan
kody watch --agent config-health
```

In GitHub Actions, trigger a specific agent via workflow dispatch on the `kody-watch.yml` workflow, using the `agent` input. This is useful for running an agent immediately from the Actions UI or via `gh workflow run`.

## Local Testing

Run Watch locally with `--dry-run` (no GitHub posts):

```bash
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) kody-engine-lite watch --dry-run
```

Run a single agent manually (also works locally):

```bash
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) kody-engine-lite watch --agent pipeline-health --dry-run
```

## State Persistence

Watch stores its state (cycle number, dedup timestamps) as a hidden HTML comment on the activity log issue:

```html
<!-- KODY_WATCH_STATE:{"system:cycleNumber":47,"watch:dedupEntries":{}} -->
```

This works with the default `github.token` — no PAT or special permissions needed. The state comment is updated in-place on each cycle.

## Deduplication

Actions are deduplicated within a time window to prevent noise:

- **pipeline-health**: 25 min window (slightly less than the 30 min cycle)
- **security-scan**: 23 hours
- **security-scan issues**: 23 hours (also checks for existing open issues before creating)
- **config-health**: 23 hours

Dedup entries older than 24 hours are automatically cleaned up.

## Watch Agents

Kody Watch also runs LLM-powered autonomous agents alongside plugins. Each agent is a folder in `.kody/watch/agents/<name>/` containing an `agent.json` and `agent.md`. Agents get a full Claude Code session with filesystem and GitHub tool access.

### Built-in Agents

| Agent | Schedule | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `stale-pr-reviewer` | every 48 cycles (daily) | Flag PRs with no activity for 7+ days |
| `todo-scanner` | every 48 cycles (daily) | Find TODO/FIXME/HACK comments and create tracking issues |
| `branch-cleanup` | every 48 cycles (daily) | Identify merged branches that can be deleted |
| `dependency-checker` | every 48 cycles (daily) | Check for outdated dependencies |
| `readme-health` | every 48 cycles (daily) | Verify README accuracy against code |
| `skill-opportunity-hunter` | weekly (Sunday 10:00 UTC) | Find patterns worth extracting into Kody skills |
| `dead-code-cleanup` | weekly (Monday 09:00 UTC) | Find unused exports, dead files, and unreachable code |
| `agent-health-checker` | daily (10:00 UTC) | Audit all watch agents: file health + GitHub outcome validation |

### skill-opportunity-hunter

Scans the codebase for patterns that could become reusable Kody skills — shell scripts, CI/CD workflows, repeated CLI calls, custom tooling. For each opportunity found, it creates a GitHub issue with:

- The detected pattern and what it does
- A suggested skill name and tool interface
- A confidence rating
- An optional skill scaffold ready to implement

Example issue created:

```markdown
## Detected from
`scripts/deploy.sh` (lines 12–34)

## What it does
Runs docker build, pushes to ECR, and deploys to ECS.

## Suggested skill name
`kody-deploy`

## Suggested tools
- `kody-deploy:run` — execute deploy with env flag
- `kody-deploy:status` — check ECS task status
```

Users review and approve before the skill is created — the agent only recommends, it never auto-registers skills.

### dead-code-cleanup

Scans for five categories of dead code:

| Category | Detection method |
|----------|----------------|
| Unused exports | `tsc --noUnusedLocals` |
| Unused imports/variables | ESLint `no-unused-vars` rules |
| Unreachable code | Comments after `return`/`throw`/`break` |
| Dead files | Files with exports but never imported |
| Git-inactive files | No commits in 90+ days |

Pre-flight checks for `tsc` and `npx` availability. If no dead code is found, no issue is created. One consolidated issue is created per cycle, grouped by category.

**Pre-flight:** Skips all detection if `tsc` or `npx` is not installed.

**Deduplication:** If an open issue with label `kody:watch:dead-code` already exists, the agent appends findings as a comment instead of creating a duplicate.

**Limits:** Max 50 findings per category (truncation noted in issue).

### agent-health-checker

Audits all installed watch agents to confirm they are healthy and producing real outcomes. Runs daily at 10:00 UTC.

**Phase 1 — File health:** Validates each agent's `agent.json` (valid JSON, required fields) and `agent.md` (non-empty).

**Phase 2 — GitHub outcome validation:** For each agent, checks for issues/PRs/workflows to confirm the agent is actually producing results — not just running.

**Phase 3 — Staleness scoring:**

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| Files valid + activity within cron interval | 🟢 Healthy |
| Files valid + no activity in 1–3× cron interval | 🟡 Stale |
| Files valid + no activity in 3×+ cron interval | 🔴 Unhealthy |
| Files invalid | 🔴 Broken |

Posts a summary issue labeled `kody:watch:agent-health` with a per-agent status table.

### Manual Agent Trigger

```bash
kody watch --agent skill-opportunity-hunter
kody watch --agent agent-health-checker
```

## Workflow Permissions

The `kody-watch.yml` workflow needs:

| Permission | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| `issues: write` | Post activity log comments, create security issues |
| `contents: read` | Checkout repo for scanning |

No PAT, no app token, no additional secrets.
